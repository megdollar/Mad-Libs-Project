To begin you will need to clone or download the ZIP repository to your local system. 

##Prerequisites

Terminal or command prompt and python

##Installing

Using the teminal or command prompt cd to the directory where the project was downloaded and run the Fill_in_the_Blanks.py file. Have fun putting all your programming terminology to work in this reverse mad-libs style program!
