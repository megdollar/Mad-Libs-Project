# Mad Libs
This is a reverse mad libs program that I wrote for lesson 2 of Udacity's Intro to Programming nanodegree.

## Getting Started

To begin you will need to clone or download the ZIP repository to your local system. 

## Prerequisites

Terminal or command prompt and python

## Installing

Using the teminal or command prompt `cd` to the directory where the project was downloaded and type `python Fill_in_the_Blanks.py`. Have fun putting all your programming terminology to work in this reverse mad-libs style program!

## Deployment

Select your level desired of difficulty to begin (1-3 simple to hard, respectively). You will be prompted with a question containing a blank space, your task is to type in the correct word for the blank. If you guess correctly the sentence will print with the blank filled in and the process will repeat with a new question. If you are incorrect you will be given another chance! This will repeat until you have filled in all of the blanks, **have fun**!
